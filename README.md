# RabbitMQ learning project, following docs and devising own queue system

Project to learn rabbitmq's behaviour and configuration

Working with the idea of horizontal scaling in mind

### There are multiple branches

- main branch has the first Hello World tutorial
- each subsequent branch is named after the docs tutorials [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-javascript)
- The python folder only covers the Hello World first tutorial; my real use-case is in TS (Nextjs and Nestjs instances) so I did the rest in Node with JS
- the hscale-sse branch covers a simulation of a closer-to-real-world scenario and I explain it in more detail in that branch's README

## Links/References

- RabbitMQ's [tutorials](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-javascript)
- RabbitMQ's [docs](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs) - to a lesser extent
- amqplib's [docs](https://amqp-node.github.io/amqplib/) - where I found out there's a promise-based API as well
